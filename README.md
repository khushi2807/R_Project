# Crop Recommendation App

![App Screenshot](<https://imgur.com/P3zizag>)

## Overview

This Shiny web application provides a crop recommendation based on input parameters such as Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium, Temperature, Humidity, pH, and Rainfall. The app utilizes a decision tree model trained on a dataset to predict the most suitable crop for the given conditions.

## Features

- Prediction: Enter parameter values and click the "Predict Crop" button to get a prediction.
- Average Parameter Levels: Visualize average parameter levels for each crop with an interactive bar chart.
- Crop Distribution: Explore the distribution of crops in a 3D scatter plot.
- Sample Data: View a DataTable displaying a subset of the dataset.
- Parameter Graphs: Access detailed plots for Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium, Temperature, Humidity, pH, and Rainfall levels for each crop.
